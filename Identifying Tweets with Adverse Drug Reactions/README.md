## Identifying Tweets with Adverse Drug Reactions Using Text Classification

- Definition of [Adverse Drug Reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction)
- A nice intro to [Text Classification](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html) using Python NLTK
- The following [data set](http://diego.asu.edu/downloads/twitter_annotated_corpus/) is used in the project, please follow the [download instructions](http://diego.asu.edu/downloads/twitter_binary_data_readme.txt) and use the python script [here](http://diego.asu.edu/downloads/download_binary_twitter_data.py) to download raw tweets if needed  
- Citation of the data source: _Abeed Sarker and Graciela Gonzalez. (2015) Portable automatic text classification for adverse drug reaction detection via multi-corpus training. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 53: 196-207._
- This provides the [background](http://diego.asu.edu/Publications/ADRClassify.html) of my project 
- There are 3 files `train.txt`, `dev.txt` and `test.txt`, each file contains the IDs of raw tweets and their corresponding classifications, `Y` for ADR presence, `N` for no ADR presence
- My report is [here](https://github.com/DonghanYang/Twitter-NLP-projects/blob/master/Identifying%20Tweets%20with%20Adverse%20Drug%20Reactions/report.pdf) and my scripts for generating features are in the repository	 	

## Credits
